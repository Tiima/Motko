- [ ] Clean commented code away
- [ ] Rewrite mainloop it contains ideas long passed
- [x] Change input output values to float
- [x] Add more input variables, energy, foodavail, food in left, food in right, food color, color, meeting motko color
- [x] Add logger
- [x] Fix logger, it does not save to a file
- [x] Create random NNs random amount hidden layers, randomize layers (linear, sigmoid, thanh, softmax etc)
- [ ] Create mating parental history what will quide new motko creation, statistical data how many layers usually have been(in parents) and how many neurons per layer.
      new motko will be created based on that.
- [ ] Use logger everywhere
